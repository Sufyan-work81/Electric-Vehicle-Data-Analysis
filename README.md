# Electric Vehicle Data Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of electric vehicle specifications for 2025 models. The project explores key performance metrics, battery characteristics, efficiency, range, and other vital features of modern electric vehicles. Using Python's powerful data science stack, I've performed data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and visualization to uncover insights about the evolving EV market.

## Key Features
- **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values and data inconsistencies
- **Exploratory Analysis**: Examined distributions and relationships between key EV metrics
- **Brand Comparison**: Analyzed performance differences between manufacturers
- **Visualization**: Created insightful charts showing range, efficiency, and performance trends
- **Feature Engineering**: Derived new insights from existing data

## Dataset
The analysis uses the `electric_vehicles_spec_2025.csv` dataset containing specifications for 478 electric vehicle models from various manufacturers. Key features include:

- **Performance Metrics**: Top speed, acceleration, torque
- **Battery Specifications**: Capacity, type, number of cells
- **Efficiency Data**: Wh/km consumption, range
- **Physical Dimensions**: Length, width, height
- **Category Information**: Segment, drivetrain, body type

## Analysis Highlights

### Battery Capacity vs Range
![Battery Range](https://via.placeholder.com/600x400?text=Battery+Capacity+vs+Range+Chart)

The analysis reveals a strong positive correlation between battery capacity and vehicle range, with some manufacturers achieving better efficiency than others.

### Acceleration Performance by Brand
```python
# Top performing brands by acceleration
top_acceleration = ev.groupby('brand')['acceleration_0_100_s'].min().sort_values()
print(top_acceleration.head(5))

# Output:
# Porsche     2.2
# Tesla       2.5
# Lucid       2.7
# BMW         3.2
# Mercedes    3.5
```

### Efficiency Distribution
![Efficiency Distribution](https://via.placeholder.com/600x400?text=Efficiency+Distribution+Chart)

Most vehicles fall in the 140-180 Wh/km efficiency range, with premium models typically showing higher efficiency.

## Technologies Used
- **Python 3.9**
